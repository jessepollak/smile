# Smile - [Download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smile/iigledfhikfbbdohdfifbdffjeokmljn)

Amazon Smile is an awesome initiative where Amazon donates 0.5% of every purchase to a charity of your choice. There's only one problem: in order to use it, you have to visit smile.amazon.com anytime you want to make a purchase. For those of us who forget things easily, that's no easy task.

This Chrome Extension will smartly redirect your browser to smile.amazon.com whenever you visit amazon.com. Your shopping won't be interrupted (it redirects you to the same page you were going to) and you'll donate to charity every time!
